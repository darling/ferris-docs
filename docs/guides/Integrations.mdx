Integrations allow Ferris to notify your community about events that you have signed up for within our [Control Panel](https://ferris.gg/control). Integrations are a Premium only feature, however, you can get premium by [donating to Ferris](https://ferris.gg/pricing).

The reason this feature is `Premium Only` is because it costs us to sign up and check for updates all the time. Any features that cost Ferris money will be a premium feature.
